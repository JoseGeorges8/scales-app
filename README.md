# Find scales app

An app that helps you know which scales contain the notes you select. Found it helpful when goofing with a keyboard.

I made the app with [flutter](https://flutter.dev/), and used [bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc) as my state management. I've also used [flutter_midi](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_midi) for playing the sounds and [shared_preferences](https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences) to persist settings.
